# Rust examples

This is a collection of scripts that I am developing while learning Rust.
They are the projects suggested on the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Installation

To run any of them, just go to the respective folder and execute:

```sh
  $ cargo build
  $ cargo run
```

## Summary projects

Here is a short description of what you can find on each project:

* **hello-rust**: Hello world.
* **guessing_game**: Use of `use`, `loop`, `match` and `loop`.
* **variables**: Short introduction to simple datatypes, tuples and arrays.
* **functions**: Introduction to functions.
* **branches**: See how control flow works.
* **loops**: Examples of `loop`, `while` and `for`.
* **ownsership**: Introduction of how ownership works on Rust.
* **rectangles**: Example of `struct`, methods and associated functions.
* **coins**: Enums and pattern matching (`match`, `if let`).
* **restaurant**: Defining Modules to control scope and privacy. It is also
the first example of a library that I have implemented.
* **restaurant2**: It is the same code as **restaurant**, but the modules have
been moved to their own separate files.
